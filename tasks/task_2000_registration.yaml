  goal: |
    Deliver the registration and email verification experience outlined in the architecture. Build the `/v1/auth/register`,
    resend, and verification endpoints with CAPTCHA enforcement, unverified account handling, and templated transactional
    emails via Celery. Create the frontend registration and verification screens, exact error messaging, and resend flows
    so new users can activate their accounts end-to-end.

  goal: |
    Build the billing plans and usage limits capabilities from the architecture. Implement plan catalog endpoints, per-user
    subscriptions, spend caps with hard-stop enforcement, and billing admin defaults. Create the frontend account billing
    and limits pages with plan comparison, usage forecasting, cap management, and hard-stop toggle behaviors tied to backend
    enforcement hooks and messaging.

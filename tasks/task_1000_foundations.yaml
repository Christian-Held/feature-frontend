  name: "AUTH Platform Foundations"
  repo_path: "feature-auth/tasks_bootstrap"
  goal: |
    Implement the core platform foundations described in the AUTH platform architecture. Stand up the PostgreSQL schema,
    Redis caches, and supporting messaging infrastructure that power authentication services. Integrate Argon2id password
    hashing, JWT signing/rotation, rate limiting, CAPTCHA receipt storage, and initial Alembic migrations for users,
    sessions, verification tokens, plans, roles, and audit logs to align with the documented data model and service layout.

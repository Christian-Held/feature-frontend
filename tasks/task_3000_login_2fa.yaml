  name: "AUTH Login, Sessions & 2FA"
  repo_path: "feature-auth/tasks_bootstrap"
  goal: |
    Implement the login, session rotation, and multi-factor workflows described in the spec. Build password authentication
    with adaptive CAPTCHA, rotating refresh tokens, session revocation, and `/v1/auth/login`, `/v1/auth/logout`, `/v1/auth/refresh`,
    and `/v1/auth/me` endpoints. Deliver the TOTP setup, verification, disable, and recovery login APIs plus matching frontend
    flows for `/login`, `/2fa/setup`, `/2fa/verify`, and recovery code handling.
